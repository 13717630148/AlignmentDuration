report: 


setting only the initial prob of first state to be diff. than zero assures the optimal path will be start first state.

we backtrack starting at the very last state.


Current state: 
testing only duraations with no ObsProbs. 

Current parameteres:

FIXED:
=Only at middle state - check bookmark in code
= with Normal distribution ( allows for 2*maxD(state) (DurationHMM.getWaitLogLik() )
)
- let currMax be 30% on top of note duration (in _calcCurrStatePhi and initPhis)
-no normalisation of durationPDF

ADJUST: 
	- then play with ALPHA (start at > 0.9)
